# Flow Head Subspecies

Flow Heads are classified into four distinct categories: Common, Uncommon, Rare, and Mythical. While the power of their elemental abilities generally increases with rarity, the control over those abilities follows an inverse patternâ€”less rare Flow Heads typically master their powers at a younger age and with greater precision. For example, a Common Flow Head might master basic abilities by age 12, whereas a Mythical Flow Head may struggle even as young adults to contain their overwhelming power.

Explore each rarity tier and their unique characteristics:
