# Flow Heads

**Flow Heads** are a warm-blooded extraterrestrial reptilian species possessing unique elemental abilities, believed to have arrived on Earth approximately 15,000 years ago. Despite their advanced capabilities, neither the Flow Heads nor their sister species retain clear memories of their origins. Current scientific speculation suggests that their ancestors may have intentionally selected Earth as an optimal environment for relocation and survival.

## Flow Head Subspecies Types {#flow-types}

There are several distinct subspecies of Flow Heads, each with unique characteristics, some are more rare than others.

Flow Heads come in 4 rarities: [Common](#common-flow), [Uncommon](#uncommon-flow), [Rare](#rare-flow), and [Mythical](#mythical-flow).

All Flow heads are born with elemental abilities, but not all Flow Heads are equal in power. It is generally known that common Flows are the weakest yet fastest to learn how to harness their abilities while mythical Flows are so strong that even they cannot control their own abilities and will likely never learn how to.

## Habitat and Distribution {#habitat}

The majority of Flow Heads reside in the Southwestern United States and Northern Mexico, with a particularly dense population in Southern Arizona. This clustering has led researchers to hypothesize that the region may have been the original landing site of their species.

### The Flow {#what-is-a-flow}

The "flow" is a distinctive and visually striking feature of Flow Heads, resembling hair but composed of the elemental energy they control. It serves as a direct conduit to their power, manifesting in varied forms depending on the individual's element and emotional state. The flow is versatile, used for defense, offense, or manipulating their element in the surrounding environment.

Flows can be cut, with severed portions dispersing like smoke regardless of element. However, some require specialized tools (i.e., hand clippers or hedge trimmers for Nature Flows or a chisel and hammer for the crystals and stones on Earth Flows) for trimming. Dyeing is also possible but element-dependent: Water flows can easily dye their flows with food coloring, while Fire flows need compounds like potassium chloride to shift their flames to purple.

Flows have a weightless, slime-like texture, though elemental variations alter this. For example: Earth-type flows mimic kinetic sand, while Poison-type flows feel like numbing glue. Generally, flows are harmless unless the Flow Head consciously expends energy to weaponize themâ€”a measure typically reserved for emergencies. For instance, a Fire Flow Head could sear skin if provoked, though their flow usually radiates only gentle warmth.

One of the most notable abilities of Flow Heads is their connection to personal pocket dimensions hidden within their flow. These dimensions are unique to each Flow-Head and serve as a sanctuary, storage space, and a thought space for their imagination. The entrance to this dimension is through their flow. Entering into these flows can only be done with the Flow Head's consent as forced entry is physically impossible.

### Flow Pocket Dimension {#pocket-dimension}

The Flow Pocket dimension is unique to every Flow Head, as every Flow Head has a personal pocket dimension that no other can access nor control. The pocket dimension can be controlled by the imagination of the Flow Head and those who are allowed to visit this dimension. Flow Heads regard their flows as deeply personal and intimate. They share access to the pocket dimension only with romantic partners, close friends, or to safeguard their young, as giving others access to their imagination leaves them in a vulnerable situation if not careful.

The Pocket Dimension can be thought of as a house for the flow-head. This is where Flow-Heads and others can come in to hang out, sleep, play games, mate, or have privacy from the outside world. They can think of objects and it would become real inside of this dimension. The problem however is that none of the objects in this dimension can be brought into our dimension, only objects that have been put in from our dimension can be taken out of Flows. Flow Heads do not gain any nutrients if they eat the food that was created in their Flow Dimension.

Prolonged stays within Flow pocket dimensions have been discouraged by mental health professionals due to this. The inside can become a legitimate Utopia for the Flow Head, often causing the mental health of the Flow Head to decline significantly when they return to our dimension. Some Flow-Heads never end up leaving their Flow's pocket dimension and end up passing away from starvation/malnutrition. If a Flow-Head dies within their Flow's pocket dimension, they tend to disappear forever with everything inside of it. Most cases of missing Flow-Heads tend to be ruled as an "In-Dimension Death Disappearance."
