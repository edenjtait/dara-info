# Common Flow Heads {#about}

Flow Heads are classified into four distinct categories: Common, Uncommon, Rare, and Mythical.

Common Flow Heads can be found anywhere and everywhere, thus, why they're called common types. They're known for having the most basic elemental manipulation abilities, of which aren't very strong. However, common flow heads have the advantage of learning how to harness their abilities with ease, often mastering them by their late teens to early adulthood.
