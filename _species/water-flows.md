# Water Flow Heads

**Water Flow Heads** were commonly found living near/in most bodies of water, from small ponds, to rivers, to the massive oceans of the world. These Flow-Heads were also found living in extreme climates such as hot springs and desert oasis, but that life decision can also decide where the last of their days are spent. Rain helped them travel freely anywhere without any problem. Most migrated with the Monsoons to help the locals on land with flooding issues.

Thanks to modern plumbing, Water Flow Heads can now live wherever freely, even having the opportunity to move back to [The Great Tree](/species/locations/great-tree/), located in Southern Arizona's Sonoran Desert.
