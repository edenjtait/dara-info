# Fire Flow Heads

**Fire Flow Heads** could be found just about anywhere, but commonly found in cities, deserts, and rocky mountains rather than forests and grasslands just to be sure that they don't cause any wildfires. Their flow may look hot, but the temperature of their flow is as hot as the air of a summer afternoon. These Flow-Heads often work as welders and fire-fighters.
