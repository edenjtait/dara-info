# About Us

The Department of AstRofauna and Abilities was founded in 1956 in partnership with the Astrofauna inhabiting our planet Earth in order to forward society's progress and understanding of the various intelligent species and their capabilities. In this website you will find detailed descriptions of our current understandings of the non-human species that co-habitate with the humans on our planet. This website is intended to be a full repository of all public information that has been confirmed by researchers and deemed notable by biologists, historians, and socioligists.
